Student Track Record using React and Spring Boot
This repository features a full-stack application for managing student records, built with a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend. 
It is designed to help developers learn how to create robust, scalable applications by integrating a modern JavaScript framework with a powerful Java backend.

Features:
React Frontend: A responsive and dynamic user interface built with React, allowing users to easily interact with student records.
Spring Boot Backend: A robust backend API developed with Spring Boot to handle data management, business logic, and server-side processing.
RESTful API: Implements a RESTful API for efficient communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth data flow and CRUD operations.
